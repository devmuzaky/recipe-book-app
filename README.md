## Live Project
The live project can be found [Here](https://recipe-book-b95aa.web.app/auth)

Experimenting with Angular 14 features

The project is a recipe book SPA that allows users to browse recipes and manage a shopping list. The project has a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend which is used to allow users to create accounts and sign in with their credentials. Authenticated users can then edit recipes, plus save and fetch data from the Firebase endpoint.

## Among the Angular 14 features that this project exhibits are:
- authentication & route protection;
- HTTP request handling;
- services & dependency injection;
- routing;
- observables;
- forms (both template-driven and reactive);
- directives, components & databinding.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
